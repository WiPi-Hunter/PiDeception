## PiDeception
If an attacker has created a fake enterprise wireless network, my goal is to deceive him.


### Description 

When attackers want to attack corporate networks, they often open a fake network with the hostapd-wpe tool. As a result, they collect user name and password information for users connected to the wireless network. The user name is open and the password is also encrypted. My purpose with this tool is to mislead the attackers.
